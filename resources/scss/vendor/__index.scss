/// Vendor imports.

/// Vendor styles handle code for specific plugins and third-party scripts that
/// would overwrite earlier styles.
///
/// Most projects will have a `vendors/` folder containing all the CSS files from
/// external libraries and frameworks – Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI, and so on.
/// Putting those aside in the same folder is a good way to say “Hey, this is not
/// from me, not my code, not my responsibility”.
